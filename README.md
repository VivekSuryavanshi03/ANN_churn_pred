# Project Title 

Customer churn is when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a firm or service.

Customer choice and active switching of service providers are available to customers in the telecom industry. The average rate of annual churn among telecommunication businesses is from 15 to 25 percent in this highly competitive market. Individualized customer retention is complicated because most organizations have very many customers and can not afford to spend plenty of time on each one of them. The costs would be too high, outnumbering the additional revenue. However, should a corporation be able to predict in advance which customers are likely to leave, it can focus customer retention efforts only on such "high-risk" clients.

It helps broaden the coverage area and fetches more customer' loyalty. The core of success in this market lies in the customer itself.

Customer churn is a critical metric, as it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers. To churn possible customers early, one should have a full-fledged overview of the customer and all customer interactions in multiple channels. Consequently, by resolving churn issues, such businesses can not only maintain their market standing but also emerge more robust and more prosperous. The more customers they have in their network, the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit. Thus, for the company's success, the central preoccupation is to reduce client attrition and, hence, implement a sufficient retention strategy.
